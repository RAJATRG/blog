When this pandemic started and India Govt. imposed a nationawide lockdown, i got bored at home on weekends. Thats when i found out about jekyll and how blogs can be hosted without a datbase. One good thing about jekyll is there are numerous free templates avalibale and posts and comment moderation is as simple as it gets.
All you require is ruby installed in your system and since its created by Github Founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner">Tom Preston-Werner</a> you can integrate and hosts site on your github reposiory.
