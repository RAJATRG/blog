excerpt: A New Year, New resolutions and new Dawn
---
Its common among people in this century to kickstart and make new resolutions on each new year. Most go down the water hole, but you try to execute at least 10% in each of those new things that you wished to change in your lives. Previous year i started with a Goal to be Fit and gain weight.
I stuck to my gym regime and diet and was able to increase my weight from 46KG to 68 KG. I think its first time I have successfully acted and completed my New Year resolution.

Now coming to year 2022 I have decided on the following resolutions
<ul>
  <li>Read at least 20 Books</li>
  <li>Write at least 2-3 times week, Journal everyday</li>
  <li>Try to be more productive and procrastinate little less</li>
  <li>Increase Stamina and Endurance and ?wink? Six Pack Abs</li>
  <li>Quit Some Habits</li>
</ul>
